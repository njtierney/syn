# syn 0.0.1 "Actual Thing"

* Implemented `ant` and `ants` functions using imported antonym dataset from wordnet - see cool work by Mike Cheng: [#20](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/syn/pull/20).
* Add a hex sticker, add and improve upon website
* Zero dependencies
* Rewrite core data structure to be a list of integer vectors. This brings the package below 5MB and does away with the need of all the
  dynamic download/load infrastructure
  
# syn 0.0.0.9000

* Initial release at ozunconf2018
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Added `syn` and `syns` and tricks to download and install the data from words repo
