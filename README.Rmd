[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/ropenscilabs/syn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ropenscilabs/syn)[![AppVeyor build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/ropenscilabs/syn?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ropenscilabs/syn)[![Coverage status](https://codecov.io/gh/ropenscilabs/syn/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/ropenscilabs/syn?branch=master)

`syn` is a **zero dependency** R package that lists synonyms and antonyms.

There are two main functions:

- `syn("great")` Returns synonyms of "great"
- `ant("great")` Returns antonyms of "great".

`syn` and `ant` take one word as input. To return synonyms for many words, use the plural form: `syn`**s**, and `ant`**s** 

- `syns(c("great", "excellent")` Returns named list of synonyms of "great", and "excellent"
- `ants(c("great", "excellent")` Returns named list of antonyms of "great", and "excellent"

## Example: Synonyms for "cool"

The `syn` function returns all synonyms for a given word:

Let's look at synonyms for "cool":

```{r example, message = FALSE, warnings = FALSE}
library(syn)

syn_cool <- syn("cool")

head(syn_cool)
tail(syn_cool)
```

Wow, there are a lot! How many are there?

```{r length-syn-cool}
length(syn_cool)
```

Wow! There are `r length(syn_cool)` synonyms for cool. That's...`r syn("cool", 1)`, I guess.

You can also provide it a number of words to return with the `n_words` argument, which will randomly select the number of words given

```{r syn-awesome-one}
syn("awesome", 1)
syn("awesome", 2)
syn("awesome", 5)
```


## Example: Creating a sentence

OK cool, let's use these in a sentence, using the `glue` package. Which of these better?

```{r example-syn-glue}

glue::glue("This is really cool!")
glue::glue("This is really {syn('cool', 1)}!")
glue::glue("This is really {syn('cool', 10)}!")
```

## Using multiple words with `syns`

You can generate synonyms for multiple words with the `syns` function. This takes a vector of words, returning a named list

```{r example-syns}
syns_good_evil <- syns(c("good", "evil"))
str(syns_good_evil)
```

You can also provide `n_words` for `syns`, and it will return a random selection of the words of that number.

```{r syns-n-words}
syns(c("good", "evil"),
     n_words =  10)
```

## Example: Antonyms (under development)

To create antonyms, use `ant` and `ants`, which have the same inputs as `syn`. However, at this stage, the number of antonyms available for use by `ant` is small.

```{r ant-n-words}
ant("good")
ant("good",1)

ant("strong")
```

```{r ants-n-words}
ants(c("good", "evil"))

ants(c("good", "evil"), n_words = 5)

ants(c("strong", "weak"))
```
